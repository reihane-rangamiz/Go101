# GoLang Exercises Repository ðŸš€

This repository serves as a journal of my learning journey in GoLang, where I gather <a href="#go-101">go101</a> questions and <a href="#hello-world">exercises</a> from various sources and my own ideas to track my progress and ensure consistent growth. It's aimed at beginners like me who are taking their first steps in learning GoLang.

Feel free to explore the exercises, provide feedback, suggest improvements, or even contribute your own exercises to help fellow learners on their path to mastering GoLang. This is a public repository, open to all, because we grow better together! 

Before getting hands-on with the exercises below, make sure you have a good grasp of the syntax (study the Go Tour from the official Go website) to avoid confusion later on.
