# Logical Operators

## Objectives

Consider the number 2000 and assign it to a variable for example: "x"

1. Write a program that checks if a number is both greater than 50 and less than 2020
2. Verify if x is greater than 50 and is an even number
3. Write a program that verifies x is an odd number 

- increment the value of x by 5. then:

4. Checks if x is greater than 50 and less than 3000.
5. Check if x is either greater than 50 or less than 2020.
6. Check if x is greater than 50 or x is divisible by 2
