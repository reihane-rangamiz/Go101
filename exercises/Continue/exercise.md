## Objectives

1. Define the following
   1. A variable called `sum` with the value of 0
   2. A for loop that iterates a variable called `i` starts with the value 0 until it reaches 100 (the variable's value is incremented by 1 each loop)
      1. If the value of i is 50, skip increasing the value of sum by `i`
      2. each loop, make sure to add the value of `i` to the value of `sum`
   3. after the loop definition, add print statement to print the value of `sum`
      1. What's the value of `sum`?
