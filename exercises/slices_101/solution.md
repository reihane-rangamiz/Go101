# Slices

### 1.

The slices like the arrays are indexed based and have size, but the arrays are fixed size while the slices are like dynamic arrays with a flexible size. The slice is actually a reference to a portion of an underlying array.


### 2. 

An empty slice of string will be like this:
```go
someSlice := []string{}

// or

var someSlice = []string{}

```

### 3.

The append function adds the desired element (here the 'abc' string)to the end of the mentioning slice


### 4. 

This action is similar to what we do with the slices:

```go
someSllice[0]
```
